This is a README.md file for a program that works with Tobii Eye Tracker devices (specifically models 4C/5). The text is in Japanese, and I'll translate the key points:

# TobiiEyeTracker.py
This is a program for analyzing data obtained from Tobii Eye Tracker 4C/5 devices using Python.

The README explains that:

1. Since these devices only provide SDK support for C language, the program works in two steps:
   - First, data is collected using a C program
   - Then, the data is sent to a Python program via Socket communication for analysis

2. The program has only been tested on Windows 10.

3. Usage instructions indicate that you need to:
   - First launch `eye_tracking.exe`
   - Then run the corresponding Python program

This appears to be a bridge solution to allow Python developers to work with Tobii Eye Tracker data, despite the SDK only being available in C.

Tobii Eye Trackers are devices that track eye movements and gaze patterns, commonly used in research, user experience testing, and accessibility applications.
